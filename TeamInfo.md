## Project Summary

FamilyHub acts as a one-stop shop that enables students across UIUC to find and join fellow classmates who are interested in starting a family plan subscription together. Numerous streaming services like Netflix, HBO Max, and Spotify offer family plans that come at the fraction of price of their corresponding individual plans. FamilyHub aims to connect like-minded students who arenâ€™t able to find group-mates and enable everyone to reap the savings of joining a family plan.

When interacting with FamilyHub, users can either create a new family plan or join an existing family plan on a specified streaming service like Netflix. Each group is composed of a host and fellow group-mates who can either join the family plan immediately or request entry from the host. Once the plan has reached its desired or maximum capacity, FamilyHub closes the group and acts a centralized platform for the group to manage their family plan and facilitate monthly transactions to the group host.
